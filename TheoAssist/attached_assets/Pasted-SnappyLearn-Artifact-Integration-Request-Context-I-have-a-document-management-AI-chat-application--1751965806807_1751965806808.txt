SnappyLearn Artifact Integration Request
Context
I have a document management & AI chat application called SnappyLearn built with React 18 + TypeScript frontend, Node.js + Express backend, PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, and OpenAI GPT-4o integration.
Current Issue
My artifact integration works during initial generation but loses chat history context when continuing conversations after artifact creation.
Required Changes
1. Fix Artifact Chat History Persistence

Modify the conversation flow to maintain chat context after artifact generation
Ensure messages with artifacts are properly stored in the database with artifact metadata
Update the AI service to include artifact history in subsequent conversation context
Fix the message threading to preserve artifact references

2. Add Dedicated Artifact Page
Create a new /artifacts route with educational tools:

Code Playground: Interactive code editor with syntax highlighting (supports HTML, CSS, JS, Python, etc.)
Math Visualizer: Interactive graphing calculator and equation solver
Document Generator: Templates for essays, reports, study guides
Quiz Builder: Create interactive quizzes and flashcards
Presentation Maker: Simple slide creator with educational themes
Data Visualizer: Chart generator for educational data
Mind Map Creator: Visual concept mapping tool

3. Technical Implementation Requirements

Add artifact metadata to the messages database schema
Create artifact storage and retrieval system
Implement artifact versioning for educational content
Add artifact sharing capabilities between users
Integrate artifacts with existing collection system
Maintain consistent SnappyLearn branding and purple gradient theme

4. UI/UX Requirements

Follow existing Radix UI + shadcn/ui design system
Responsive design for mobile and desktop
Integrate with current sidebar navigation
Add artifact preview thumbnails
Include search and filter functionality for artifacts

Please implement these changes while maintaining the existing authentication system, database structure, and overall architecture.
