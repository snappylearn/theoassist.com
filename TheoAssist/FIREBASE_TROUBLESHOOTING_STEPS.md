# Complete OAuth Setup - Final Configuration

## ✅ What's Implemented
- Created proper `/auth/callback` route that handles OAuth tokens
- Updated Google OAuth to redirect to `/auth/callback` instead of root
- Cleaned up AuthContext to remove token processing (now handled by callback page)
- Added proper loading state and error handling

## 🔧 Required Supabase Settings

### 1. Update Supabase URL Configuration
Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > URL Configuration:

**Site URL:**
```
https://theo-assist.replit.app
```

**Redirect URLs (add these):**
```
https://theo-assist.replit.app/auth/callback
```

### 2. Verify Google Provider Settings
Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Providers > Google:
- ✅ Enabled: ON
- ✅ Client ID: [your Google Client ID]
- ✅ Client Secret: [your Google Client Secret]

## 🔧 Required Google Cloud Console Settings

### Authorized JavaScript Origins:
```
https://ptlhykwgdidqgaimaxcj.supabase.co
https://theo-assist.replit.app
http://localhost:5000
```

### Authorized Redirect URIs:
```
https://ptlhykwgdidqgaimaxcj.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```

## 🧪 Testing the Complete Flow

### On Deployed App:
1. Go to https://theo-assist.replit.app/
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Sign in with Google
4. Should redirect to https://theo-assist.replit.app/auth/callback
5. Should see "Completing sign in..." loading screen
6. Should automatically redirect to dashboard as logged-in user

### On Development:
1. Go to http://localhost:5000/
2. Same flow as above but with localhost URLs

## 🔍 Debug Information
Watch browser console for these logs:
```
🚀 Initiating Supabase Google OAuth...
🔗 Processing OAuth callback...
✅ OAuth session established successfully
User: josiah...@gmail.com
```

## ⚡ Next Steps
1. Update Supabase Site URL and Redirect URLs
2. Test OAuth flow on deployed app
3. Confirm successful login to dashboard

The OAuth implementation is now complete and follows best practices with proper callback handling!
