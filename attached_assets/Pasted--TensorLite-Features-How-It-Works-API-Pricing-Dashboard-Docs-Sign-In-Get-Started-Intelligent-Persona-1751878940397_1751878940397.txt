How It Works

Build powerful data experiences in minutes

From initialization to production in three simple steps
1. Initialize Collections

Create intelligent data collections with a single API call. TensorLite automatically configures optimal settings for search and chat.

// Initialize a collection
const response = await fetch('https://api.tensorlite.ai/initCollection', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "collectionName": "articles"
  })
});

2. Index Documents

Add content to your collections with the indexing API. Vector embeddings are automatically generated for semantic search and AI chat.

// Index a document
await fetch('https://api.tensorlite.ai/index/articles', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "title": "Vector Search",
    "content": "A guide to vector search..."
  })
});

3. Search & Chat

Enable users to find and interact with your content through powerful search and natural language conversation APIs.

// Chat with your data
const response = await fetch('https://api.tensorlite.ai/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "collectionName": "articles",
    "query": "How do I implement search?"
  })
});
